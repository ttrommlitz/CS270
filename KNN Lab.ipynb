I ran the classifier for p values of 1, 2, and 3, along with test train splits of .15, .2, and .25. The training and testing accuracy results are in the tables above. p values of 1 and 2 had similar performances to each other across the 3 train-test splits in the testing accuracy, while p=1 had slightly higher training accuracies. A p value of 3 performed similarly in training accuracy to p=2 but slightly worse in testing accuracy, dropping by about 3% across each train-test split. This may mean that a higher p value leads to slightly more overfit for this dataset. In general, independent of the split, a p value of 1 is best for this dataset because it as the highest training accuracies and is about tied for the highest testing accuracies. In particular, a good train-test split would be .2 because that had the highest testing accuracy when p=1. \n",

These represent the probabilities of a given instance being predicted as each output class. There are 6 possible classes, so each instance has 6 different probabilities that sum to 1. When examinining the probabilities, there are a few instances that the model was very uncertain about, where the highest probability was only .4. Instances such as these are probably why the model's testing accuracies were in the .70s."

We should normalize input data so that when calculating distance to discover the k-nearest neighbors, all features are considered equally."

I do not think that this is a sign of overfit because the testing accuracy did not decrease, so I believe that this is still an overall improvement due to the jump in training accuracy. I'm not sure why the inclusion of distance weighting affected training accuracy so much but not testing accuracy. My hypothesis is that the dataset is not complex enough to benefit heavily from distance weighting, and the default of uniform weighting is already capturing the best possible testing accuracy for KNN.

Generally, higher k values lead to underfit in the model because the generated neighborhoods of classes become larger. I think that the reason that a higher k value is the best for this dataset is likely because the data is complex enough that many neighboring nodes are required to accurately predict a given instance's class.

However, from about k=9 and up, it looks like the graph is becoming stagnant, with little improvement in testing accuracies. My hypothesis is that if we were to try k values above 15 (perhaps up to 20 or 30), we would begin to see testing accuracies decrease as the model would begin to underfit the data. "

To create this function, I first had to store in a list which features were nominal. When computing the distance between 2 instances, I looped over their features. If the current feature was in my list of nominal features, I used 0/1 distance, and if it was not, I used euclidean distance. I summed up these distances, and returned the square root of the result as the final distance between the 2 instances."

       "I coded up both a KNNClassifier and a KNNRegressor. On the magic_telescope dataset, I achieved a testing accuracy of .34. The classifier model took a long time to run (more than 2 minutes on the testing set), so I decided not to compute the training accuracy because of how long it would take to classify that many instances. I believe that I am not being as efficient as possible when predicting a new instance because the sklearn model only takes a few seconds to classify the same dataset. Coding up the KNNClassifier showed that KNN is a lazy model that does not do any training. It does all the required work when classifying an instance. I also learned that efficiency when coding a model is extremely important because we would ideally like to use the model on very large datasets. If the model is not efficient internally, it will take a very long time to fully classify larger datasets. The sklearn model was able to achieve testing accuracy scores in the .80s, but my classifier only achieved a testing accuracy of .34. To me, this is an indicator that there is probably a logic error in my implementation.\n",
       "\n",
       "I also created a KNNRegressor model to perform regression with KNN. This was much easier to implement because it looks very similar to the classifier. The only difference is the model uses a slightly different function of the distances to compute a regression value instead of a class value. On the housing dataset, the regressor achieved a training score of -3.14 and a testing score of -3.60. For a regressor, the score is the coefficient of determination between the predicted regression values and the actual values. According to the sklearn documentation, a negative score is possible. A score of 0 means the model is performing randomly, so a negative score means the model is performing even worse than random. The sklearn implementation achieved a testing score of .78 on the housing dataset. This is another sign that there is probably a bug in my implementation because of the disparity between my model's score and the sklearn model's score. I still feel that I learned a lot from implementing my own KNN models and I've gained an increased understanding of the KNN algorithm on topics such as the distances calculation, the lazy learning aspect of the algorithm, the weighted distances, and more.
